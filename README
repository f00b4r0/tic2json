TIC output from electronic meters is either:
 - 7E1@1200bps for "historique" mode
 - 7E1@9600bps for "standard" mode

The current implementation only supports TIC version 02 at this time.

A tty interfaced to the meter TIC output can be set using the following `stty`
settings:
1:0:9ad:0:3:1c:7f:15:4:5:1:0:11:13:1a:0:12:f:17:16:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

The output of this tool is suitable for feeding a Telegraf socket_listener
configured as follows:

[[inputs.socket_listener]]
  service_address = "udp://:8094"
  data_format = "json"
  json_strict = true
  json_name_key = "label"

The following command line can be used to send adequate data:
stdbuf -oL ./tic2json < /dev/ttyS0 2>/dev/null | while read line; do echo "$line" | nc -q 0 -u telegraf_host 8094; done
